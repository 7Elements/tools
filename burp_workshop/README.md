# Burp Plugin Development for Java n00bs #
This workshop was first given at 44Con 2012 by Marc Wickenden.

The idea behind the workshop was to show how, without any prior Java knowledge you can extend Burp and get a meaningful plugin to help you in a web application assessment.

The specific example given is decoding Fastinfoset XML compression.

All code is designed to intercept requests from the RepeatAfterMeClient.exe to the RepeatAfterMe WCF service.
